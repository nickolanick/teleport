This guide explains how to label nodes with Open Source, Enterprise Teleport,
self-hosted or cloud editions.

## Labeling Nodes and Applications

In addition to specifying a custom nodename, Teleport also allows for the
application of arbitrary key-value pairs to each node or app, called labels. There are two kinds of labels:

1. `static labels` do not change over time, while [`teleport`](../reference/cli.mdx#teleport) the process is running.  Examples of static labels are the physical location of nodes, the name of the environment (staging vs production), etc.
2. `dynamic labels` also known as "label commands" allow to generate labels at runtime. Teleport will execute an external command on a node at a configurable frequency and the output of the command becomes the label value. Examples include reporting load averages, presence of a process, time after the last reboot, etc.

There are two ways to configure node labels.

1. Via command line, by using `--labels` flag to `teleport start` command.
2. Using `/etc/teleport.yaml` configuration file on the nodes.

To define labels as command line arguments, use `--labels` flag like shown
below. This method works well for static labels or simple commands:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --labels uptime=[1m:"uptime -p"],kernel=[1h:"uname -r"]
```

Alternatively, you can update `labels` via a configuration file:

```yaml
ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # ...
  # Static labels are simple key/value pairs:
  labels:
    environment: test
app_service:
  # ..
  labels:
    environment: test
```

To configure dynamic labels via a configuration file, define a `commands` array
as shown below:

```yaml
ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # Dynamic labels AKA "commands":
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
  - name: arch
    command: [uname, -p]
    # This setting tells teleport to execute the command above
    # once an hour. this value cannot be less than one minute.
    period: 1h0m0s
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # ...
  # Dynamic labels (historically called "commands"):
  commands:
  - name: hostname
    command: [hostname]
    period: 1m0s
```

`/path/to/executable` must be a valid executable command (i.e. executable bit
must be set) which also includes shell scripts with a proper [shebang
line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_\(Unix\)).

<Admonition type="tip">
Notice that `command` setting is an array where the first element
is a valid executable and each subsequent element is an argument, i.e:

```yaml
# Valid syntax:
command: ["/bin/uname", "-m"]

# INVALID syntax:
command: ["/bin/uname -m"]

# If you want to pipe several bash commands together, here's how to do it:
# notice how ' and " are interchangeable and you can use it for quoting:
command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "uname -a | egrep -o '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'"]
```
